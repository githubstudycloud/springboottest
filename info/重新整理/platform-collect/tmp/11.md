I'll help create a comprehensive design plan for this distributed data collection and processing system. Let me break it down into key architectural components and implementation approaches.

## System Architecture Overview

The system will follow a modular, microservices-based architecture that can seamlessly switch between single-node and cluster deployments. Here's how we'll structure it:

### 1. Core System Components

The system will be divided into these primary services:

1. Data Collection Service
    - Handles data source connections and extraction
    - Supports multiple source types (SQL databases, NoSQL, APIs, files)
    - Implements configurable collection strategies
    - Manages collection scheduling and monitoring

2. Data Processing Service
    - Performs data transformation and calculations
    - Handles data validation and cleaning
    - Manages processing workflows
    - Supports real-time and batch processing

3. Data Storage Service
    - Manages data persistence across different storage systems
    - Handles data versioning and historical tracking
    - Implements caching strategies
    - Manages data lifecycle

4. Visualization Service
    - Provides interactive dashboards
    - Supports real-time data visualization
    - Manages chart configurations
    - Handles user customizations

5. Configuration Service
    - Centralizes system configuration
    - Manages environment-specific settings
    - Handles dynamic configuration updates
    - Controls feature toggles

### 2. Technology Stack Implementation

Let's detail how we'll implement each component:

#### Backend Stack:
```
- Core Framework: Spring Boot 3.2.9
  - Spring Cloud for microservices
  - Spring Data for database access
  - Spring Security for authentication
  - Spring AOP for cross-cutting concerns

- Database Layer:
  - Primary: MySQL 8.0 for transactional data
  - Cache: Redis 7.x for high-speed caching
  - Document Store: MongoDB 6.x for flexible data storage
  - Analytics: ClickHouse for high-performance analytics
  - Local Storage: SQLite for single-node deployment

- Message Queue:
  - RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery
  - Kafka for high-throughput streaming

- Service Discovery:
  - ZooKeeper for cluster coordination
  - Eureka for service registration

- Monitoring:
  - Prometheus for metrics collection
  - Grafana for visualization
  - ELK Stack for log aggregation
  - Jaeger for distributed tracing
```

#### Frontend Stack:
```
- Vue 3 with Composition API
- Vuex for state management
- Vue Router for navigation
- Element Plus for UI components
- ECharts for data visualization
- Axios for API communication
```

#### Infrastructure:
```
- Docker for containerization
- Kubernetes for orchestration
- Nginx for load balancing
- Jenkins for CI/CD
```

### 3. Configuration Management

The system will implement a hierarchical configuration approach:

```
1. Global Configuration
   - System-wide settings
   - Default values
   - Feature toggles

2. Environment Configuration
   - Environment-specific settings
   - Resource configurations
   - Security settings

3. Service Configuration
   - Service-specific settings
   - Connection parameters
   - Performance tuning

4. Deployment Configuration
   - Single-node vs cluster settings
   - Scaling parameters
   - Resource allocation
```

### 4. Data Flow Architecture

The system will implement a flexible data pipeline:

```
1. Collection Layer
   - Source connectors
   - Collection schedulers
   - Data extractors
   - Validation rules

2. Processing Layer
   - Transformation pipelines
   - Calculation engines
   - Business rule processors
   - Data enrichment

3. Storage Layer
   - Write adapters
   - Cache managers
   - Version controllers
   - Archive handlers

4. Presentation Layer
   - API endpoints
   - Real-time websockets
   - Dashboard renderers
   - Export handlers
```

### 5. Deployment Models

The system will support multiple deployment models:

```
1. Single-Node Deployment
   - All components on one machine
   - Embedded databases
   - Local message queue
   - Simplified configuration

2. Cluster Deployment
   - Distributed components
   - High availability
   - Load balancing
   - Auto-scaling

3. Hybrid Deployment
   - Mixed mode operation
   - Selective component distribution
   - Flexible scaling
```

### 6. Project Structure

The project will follow a modular structure:

```
platform-root/
├── platform-common/          # Common utilities and base classes
├── platform-config/          # Configuration management
├── platform-collector/       # Data collection service
├── platform-processor/       # Data processing service
├── platform-storage/         # Storage service
├── platform-visualization/   # Visualization service
├── platform-monitor/         # Monitoring and logging
├── platform-security/        # Security and authentication
└── platform-web/            # Web interface
```

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these components or discuss specific implementation details for any part of the system?
