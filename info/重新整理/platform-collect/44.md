I'll help you create a comprehensive guide for setting up and configuring various databases with Spring Boot 3.2.9. Let's break this down systematically, starting with MySQL.



I've started with detailed configurations for MySQL and Redis. Let me know if you'd like me to continue with the configurations for:

1. RabbitMQ
2. Kafka
3. Zookeeper
4. ClickHouse
5. MongoDB

For each one, I'll cover:
- Single instance setup
- Cluster configuration
- Multi-source configuration where applicable
- Connection pooling and optimization
- Common usage patterns
- Transaction management
- Error handling and retry mechanisms

Which database would you like me to cover next?

Also, for the configurations I've already provided, would you like me to explain any specific part in more detail or provide additional examples for particular use cases?
